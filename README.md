To set up this application first run `npm i` in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies. 

Afterward you can run `npm run seed` to have the seed file contained in the _tasks_ folder to initalize and populate the database with users, posts, and comments. 

To run the application run `npm start` and the terminal will provide you a message saying to go to http://localhost:3000/ 

From there you can login with user information from the database or sign up as a new user. 

Once signed in you can create, edit, delete posts as well as like and comment on your own and others posts. You can mark comments on your own posts that resolve your post.

You can also access your own profile to see all the posts you made.

Here is the login information for each of the users in the seed file. Each user signs in with their email:

user1- email: sholmes@email.com password: elementarymydearwatson

user2- email: elemon@email.com password: damnyoujackdonaghy

user3- email: sh@email.com password: 123
